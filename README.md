# Black-Scholes-model
the code is used to solve the problem in Black Scholes model

the black scholes model questions is described as

We are here interested in simulating the stock price at times t ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}, that is, in simulating the vector (S0, S0.5, S1). As seen in class, the numerical algorithm to simulate (S0, S0.5, S1) is

question1:Run this algorithm N = 250 times, and compute the mean of the values you obtain for S1,

question2:Consider a call option with strike K = 100 and maturity T = 1. Using the N = 250 simulations to compute π0 by Monte Carlo approximation

question3:Consider now an option with payoff (S0+S0.5+S1 − 100)+. Using the N = 250 simulations to compute π0 by Monte Carlo approximation

these code are running on PYTHON
